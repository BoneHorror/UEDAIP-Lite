This is a side project I started quite a bit ago. The intention with UEDAIP Lite (name tbd) is to create a modded version of StarCraft that brings over bugfixes and QoL from UEDAIP, but doesn't fundamentally change balance or add new units.
It's a result of me being salty whenever I go back to play a game like HoMM3, AoW etc. and I can't find any mods that modernize it without adding a bunch of other shit.

The scope is to completely port over AI mechanic changes and unit bugfixes (unit freeze etc.) - which is mostly done - and then make the campaigns a bit better but without major map changes. This part is still WIP.
